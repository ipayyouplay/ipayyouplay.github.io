      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        Since I was six, playing video games has been among my biggest hobbies. Between playing piano at my school’s talent show, being on the swim team, and getting straight As in all my APs, I always found time for a good gaming session with friends. Nonetheless, I never had the privilege of spending any money on purchasing games, so I grew up playing free ones while longing for the newest video game releases on Steam. Now that I’m older, I want to provide others with what I couldn’t have.

      <h2>The Benefits of Gaming</h2>
      <p>
        Video games have been a great outlet for me to release stress. After a hard day at school, an hour-long session can lift my spirits and rejuvenate me for the next day to come. Additionally, gaming has served as a medium to deepen my existing friendships while making new ones. Whether it’s just conversing with friends over a Discord call while playing games in the background, or engaging in an intense 1V1, video games have made a positive impact on my relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, there have been countless times when I joined my friend’s online lobby, only to notice another stranger there. After a couple of rounds together, we soon started talking, and I later met them in person.
      </p>
      <p>
        My relationships through gaming have also generated a positive effect in real life: one of the first friends I made after transferring to a new high school was when I walked by his desk and happened to see him playing a game I held dearly to my heart. After we added each other in that game, our friendship blossomed, and he’s now the only person I can ask about the homework in that class.

      <h2>Scientific Support</h2>
      <p>
        The benefits of gaming are numerous:
      </p>
      <p>
        Mental health has become an increasingly prominent issue in the wake of the pandemic. A study by the NIH has proven the positive effects of gaming on depression and anxiety. Furthermore, regular usage has shown a beneficial impact on cognitive flexibility, information processing, and contrary to popular belief, attention control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, elderly people also seem to profit greatly: another study by the NIH found that gaming improved memory and cognition in older adults. Not only has it been proven that regular gaming improves health, the sheer accessibility of it makes video games a real alternative to traditional mental health treatment methods.
