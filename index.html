            <h3>Free Video Games For Those Who Need It</h3>
            <p>Hey friends,  can't buy a video game on Steam? I've been there too.
            </p>
            <p>That's why I made this charity site. So you can buy the games you always wanted.</p>
            <p>This site pays for the games using money people donate, so if you're interested, please reciprocate.</p>
        </div>

                <p>How It Works</p>
            </div>
            <p>If you're here, you're probably itching to buy that steam game you never could get. It sounds too good to be true! Here's the deal:</p>
            <div class = "rules">
                <p>1. There is a collective fund everyone draws from when they purchase games (above)</p>
                <p>2. Click the request button to fill out a form with the game you'd like to be donated, and fill out a waiver with your parents</p>
                <p>3. If I have enough money, I will respond to your request. Otherwise you will wait in a <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BZIzCMBTkiVAcwJUNIoqHQnzSEPeE_iR9kPldP65hsw/edit?usp=sharing"></a>queue.</p>
                <p>4. 2 Weeks after you first received your game, you will receive a request to fill out a 1-minute form detailing the impact of the game on your life</p>
            </div>
